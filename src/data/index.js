    description: `Along her route, Miriam also stopped by the spectacular <strong>Lefay Resort &amp; Spa,</strong> overlooking <strong>Lake Garda</strong>.
        The epitome of relaxed luxury and a prime spot for those who appreciate <strong>peace &amp; quiet, exquisite food, and high-quality service</strong>: 
        particularly couples. Whilst the facilities are not brand new, they have a well-used but well-maintained charm. The property is home to an 
        <strong>amazing spa</strong> over multiple floors. Recommended treatments include the <strong>Candle Massage</strong> and the 
        <strong>La Luna Nel Lago</strong> (Salt Water Lake). The latter alternates between bathing in the 38°C Lake and relaxing, allowing the body 
        to absorb minerals from the water. The food at <strong>La Limonaia</strong> restaurant deserves a shout-out with its daily changing menu 
        full of impressive &amp; sumptuous dishes. RASK is a Preferred Partner of Lefay and has access to special rates and benefits when you book 
        through us!`,
